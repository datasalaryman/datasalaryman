Hi, I'm readylayerone_, I'm a fullstack web + Solana program developer. I'm learning everything I can from [blueshift.gg](https://blueshift.gg/#) and am working on [promisekeepr.xyz](https://promisekeepr.xyz) 

I've worked at a Web3 startup for almost 4 years wearing many hats. Among the things I've worked on include:

- A fullstack web platform with [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/docs), [tRPC](https://trpc.io/), [drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/), [React](https://react.dev/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) end-to-end that monitors automation runs
- AWS configuration with [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform) of the startup, including [domain routing](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/), [service provisioning](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/), [security](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/), and [solutions architecutre](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs). Included here are decisions on [cost and optimization](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/).
- REST and Websocket APIs with [trpc-openapi](https://github.com/trpc/trpc-openapi), [fastify](https://fastify.dev/) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) that integrated with external services
- Realtime streaming websocket servers that stream [Helius](https://www.helius.dev/) webhook events that tracked events and the subscribers to them and liquidity pool prices from [birdeye.so](https://birdeye.so/)
- A fullstack data platform which included orchestration on [dagster](https://dagster.io/), data storage on [Google Bigquery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery?hl=en), and a presentation layer on [Redash](https://redash.io/)
- CI/CD workflows using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) with self-hosted action runners

Hi, I'm readylayerone, I'm a fullstack web developer. I'm learning everything I can from [blueshift.gg](https://blueshift.gg/#) and am working on [promisekeepr.xyz](https://promisekeepr.xyz) 

I've worked at a Web3 startup for almost 4 years wearing many hats. Among the things I've worked on include:

- A fullstack web platform end-to-end that monitors automation runs
- AWS configuration, including infrastructure provisioning and decisions on cost and optimization
- An event-driven architecture for performing trades on on-chain events
- A fullstack data platform for business metrics and data analysis

# Expectations for a working relationship

I want us to enjoy working together. We don't need to see eye to eye with each other on a personal level, but if we don't enjoy our work together, it becomes a difficult thing to manage. Whether work or personal, I expect us to be adults. 

I want us to have a professional relationship. This means being partners at getting things done. I work best when I have a clear understanding of what success looks like and what I’m accountable for. In my experience, this makes it easier to discuss concrete steps together. I appreciate when managers have a vision of success, and I'm equally happy to help explore and define those goals together if you're still figuring things out.

I’d appreciate clear communication about my responsibilities and the expectations for my role. I'm committed to over-communicating what I can do for you and what I'll need to get it done. If priorities shift or new projects arise, I’m happy to adapt, provided we discuss the necessary support and timelines to set me up for success. If I'm not getting done what I need to get done, I value direct and timely feedback so we can address it quickly.

I’m passionate about growing in my craft and delivering high-quality work, which often requires focused time to dive deep into tasks. To stay efficient, I tend to batch my communication, but I’m open to finding a rhythm that works for the team. Unless there's an incident, I tend to check Slack twice a day, once at 12nn and once at 5pm UTC+8. That said, I’ll always ensure critical issues are surfaced and addressed promptly. I’ve found tools like Linear helpful for keeping work organized and context clear, and I’d be happy to explore similar systems your team uses to streamline collaboration. For incident management, I’ve seen tools like BetterStack work well for real-time alerts, but I’m flexible and eager to adopt the team’s preferred workflows.

If I'm hired for a technical role, and you are a technical peer/manager/leader, I'd appreciate if you are knowledgeable about building and shipping full-stack web applications. Otherwise, if this becomes a source of friction for either side, I'm happy share learning resources as well as receive them from a more knowledgeable peer. If I’m in a position to mentor or supervise others, I’ll apply the same standard in supporting their growth and clarity.

# Onboarding PRs

Before making contributions to a new Github repository, new devs should asked to do what is called an "Onboarding PR". 

The PR does a few things for the new dev:
- makes sure they are able to faithfully run the application on their machine
- ensures they are able to install dependencies and get the environment variables they need
- gets them familiar with the workflow when doing dev work
- starts the communication threads with key stakeholders (maintainer, other devs, etc)

This in turn forces the entire dev team to:
- keep the README and any .env.example files so future devs' onboarding time is faster
- be mindful of documenting any changes to tooling, dependencies, etc
- ensure that the new dev has everything they need to succeed
- uncover any knowledge gaps that could then be solved during training

It's an additional step to onboarding on both sides, but it makes life easier for everyone.

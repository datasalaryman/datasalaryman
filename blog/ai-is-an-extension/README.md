# AI is an extension of your hand

Everyone and their mom is talking about AI taking over software jobs. I'm skeptical. The way these machines work is we give it information, it looks for patterns, and it dances based on what we ask it to do. The best code AI can produce will come from the average dev, by definition. I've seen enough code written by the average dev. And I'm convinced there will always be work for engineers that are looking for problems to solve.

I've used AI tools in my work and in my side projects. I love it and I hate it. I love it because it allows me to work faster and to use functions and parameters that I didn't know were available. I don't like it when it goes off the rails and changes my code in a way I did not intend. So far, the best case of these tools seem to be:

> Do this specific thing I want to do, but faster than I can type

That's it. 

Honestly, if everyone building Coding AI tools would focus on this, then my life as a developer would improve dramatically. I'm happiest with Cursor when I try to do a find and replace and it automatically suggests what I want with a `Tab`. It makes me go faster. I love Cursor suggesting the `useState` hook from the right field when I type `const {` and then `Tab` to finish the line. This is when Cursor and I are friends.

All good tech is like this. It doesn't try to replace humans. It's an extension of their hand. Stone tools, spears, scythes and hoes, levers and gears, and now computing machines. These are not replacements for humans. This allows mankind to do a task more precisely, in less time, or with more output per unit effort.

Vim/Neovim is a great tool. It's incredibly powerful when editing code lines and lines long. Try navigating your 100-file, 10000 line code-base with a mouse and every new dev will be overwhelmed. Experienced Vim users only need keystrokes and the Telescope plugin to get the job done. It's a tool that has a steep learning curve. God knows how many first time users panic when they have to exit Vim (it's `:q!` by the way). But those who get good at it, do their work more precisely and faster as a result.

A lot of people are trying to use AI to do something they don't understand. They are trying to get answers when most of the time, the answers are as good as the questions asked. The truth is, like in vim, your use of it will only be as good as your input. You have to give more to get more. Asking Cursor to `Make me a webserver` will not give you any good results. You didn't tell it what language to write it in. You didn't tell it what routes it should have. You didn't specify what the default `index.html` file should be. Ultimately, you aren't able to describe basic characteristics that make a webserver a webserver. AI isn't limited in that way. It's limited by your lack of knowledge. 

AI is not replacing any jobs. The people who are good at their jobs are going to do it faster. Beginners who are curious will have an easier time building applications. And the people who want AI to do their job for them will continue to be in the dark. Tools only become useful when we learn to use it effectively. It's important more than ever to know know what you're doing so that the AI can do it well and faster for you.
